              <br/>
			  <span class="BodyText">
             The website <a href="us.ekoloko.com" target="_blank">www.ekoloko.com</a> (the “Site”) is operated and presented to Users by Virtual Tweens Ltd., 29 Harash Street, POB 7357, Hod HaSharon, Israel 45240 (“We, Our or Us”).  This Privacy Policy sets forth the information practices of the Site, including Our collection, use and disclosure of information.  <br>
<br>
We are committed to safeguarding any personal information collected on the Site.  We ensure that Our Privacy Policy and information practices conform to the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, other applicable data privacy laws, and all other applicable legislation.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time at Our sole discretion.  We will inform Users of the Site of any such amendments by posting a new Privacy Policy on the Site home page including a clear indication of the new effective date.  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, Users include anyone who accesses or registers for the Site and, if the User is a minor, the parent or legal guardian of that minor (together, “User, Users, You or Your”).  As required by law, We will not use personal information in ways that are materially different from the ones set forth in this Privacy Policy without providing notification of such practices and obtaining consent.  If We make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, We will post a notice of these changes on the Site and in this Privacy Policy and, to the extent required by applicable law, We will obtain Users’ consent.  Users are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.  <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy only applies to information a User provides to Us while visiting or using Our Site.  Information a User may provide in visiting or using Our Site falls into two broad categories:  Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Aggregate Information (“AI”).  PII is information that is personal to a User and which can be used to identify or contact a User, including first and last name, home or other physical address including street name and city or town, email address, telephone number, Social Security number, or any other identifying information that would permit physical or online contact with a User.  Aggregate Information is information that does not identify a User, and may include, for example, statistical information concerning the web pages on Our Site that Users most frequent and Users' activities on the Site.  Our Privacy Policy governs both categories of information, as detailed below.
              </span><br>
<br>
              <span class="FAQTitle">1.   Information We Collect</span><br>
              <br>
              <span class="BodyText">
              <u>1.1  Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)</u>
              <br><br>
We require consent from a parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) when a minor User wishes to register for the Site.  During the registration process, We directly collect certain information from the User, including a Parent’s email address; a User name and password; and the minor User’s gender,  birthday (date, month and year) and email address.  Some of this information is PII.  We may not, and do not, require a User to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in activities on Our Site.  Users are not required by law to provide such information, but must provide it if they wish to become a registered User of the Site and receive additional communications as detailed in Sections 1.2 and 2 of this Privacy Policy.  <br>
<br>
Parents can review a minor User’s PII, ask to have it deleted, and refuse to allow any further collection of use of the minor User’s PII.  See Section 4 for procedures Parents should follow for such review, deletion or collection requests.  <br>
<br>
When a User becomes a paid registrant of the Site, We engage third parties to collect PII from the payer on behalf of such User.  The types of information that may be collected and stored at that time include the payer's full name, email address, credit card billing information including mailing address, and such other information as may be requested from time to time.  That information is safeguarded with appropriate security and it will not be used for other purposes.  The third parties We engage to collect payment information from Our Users have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal and financial information they obtain from Site Users, and to only use this information on Our behalf.  <strong>We encourage all Users to read the privacy policies and other terms of such third parties' websites before using their services. </strong> <br>
<br>
<strong>The Site gives Users the ability to chat and interact with other Users.  For Users’ safety, We strongly encourage Users to not disclose their PII to other Users, or ask other Users for their PII while on the Site.  If You disclose PII through the chat function or while interacting with other Users while using the Site, be aware that such information could be read, collected or used by other Users.  We are not responsible for the PII You submit through the chat function or while otherwise interacting with other Users while using the Site.  </strong><br>
<br>
If a User does not provide certain PII to Us, then We may not permit that User’s Site registration or membership and that User may be denied access to certain content, games and other functions on the Site, or other information, products or services. 
              <br><br>
              <u>1.2 Aggregate Information (“AI”)</u>
              <br><br>
AI includes information concerning Users’ activities at the Site (including, but not limited to, statistical information about which pages are visited, the date and time of the visits, other User activities and how long Users view the Site pages) and information Users’ browser sends whenever Users visit a website (such as computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web pages that were visited before visiting the Site).  <br>
<br>
When a User uses a widget or any other tool offered by Us, whether on the Site or on a third party website, including a website owned or operated by a User, We may record data related to that activity, the deployment of the widget or tool, and any other account related data.<br>
<br>
We or a third party acting on Our behalf may collect this AI through the use of technology such as unique identifiers, or “cookies,” as set forth in Section 1.3.
              <br><br>
              <u>1.3 Cookies</u>
              <br><br>
             We use “cookies” to save User name, password and language selection for future log-ins to the Site, to better understand how Users interact with the Site, and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Site. <br>
<br>
Cookies are small text files that a website can use to recognize repeat Users, to facilitate the User's ongoing access to and use of the website, and to compile aggregate data to improve the website.  Cookies work as follows: We will send a cookie to a User’s browser that uniquely associates that User’s computer with information stored at the Site.  That User’s browser places the cookie in its cookies file.  When that User next accesses the Site on his or her computer, the Site recognizes the cookie, makes available the stored information (such as User names, password and language selection), and may add new information based on the present visit.  
              <br><br>
              <u>1.4 Communications</u>
              <br><br>
           We collect, store and may review records of communications that Users send to the Site.  When a User sends email or other communications to Us, regardless of whether or not the communication contains PII, We may retain those communications in order to process that User’s inquiries, respond to requests, and improve Our services. <br>
<br>
Users are free at any time to opt-out of receiving email and other information We may send to them by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in such communications, or by <a href="http://us.ekoloko.com/ekoloko/website/us/RemoveEmailForm.html?language=us" target="_blank">contacting Us</a>, or by sending written notification by registered mail to Our address set forth in Section 6.  If a User elects to opt-out of receiving emails regarding compliance with the Site's Terms and Conditions and other rules and policies to such email address, We may immediately terminate that User’s account and membership with, and access to, and use of the Site.
              <br>
              <br>
              <u>1.5 Other Websites, Third Party Surveys and Questionnaires</u>
              <br><br>
             We offer and provide access to the Site in connection with other websites. Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to those sites may be sent to us in order to enable use of the Site. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <strong>The other websites have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</strong>
              <br><br>
             This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site.  We do not exercise control over hyperlinks that link to external websites from within the Site.  We may present links in a format that enables Us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.  In addition, third party companies and individuals which We use to perform services related to administration of the Site (including without limitation bill and credit card payment processing), and other websites, may place their own cookies or other files on Users’ computers or collect data or solicit PII directly from Our Users.  Other websites may follow different rules regarding the collection, use or disclosure of PII that You submit.    We offer and provide access to the Site in connection with other websites.  PII that Our Users provide to those other websites may be sent to Us in order to enable Our Users’ use of the Site.  We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Other websites may have different privacy practices.  <strong>We encourage Users to read the privacy policies and other terms and familiarize themselves with the privacy practices of the other websites before using their services.  </strong><br>
<br>
Users may be offered through the Site to participate in third party surveys and questionnaires which may include disclosure of Your personal information. <strong> A minor User’s participation in surveys and questionnaires is not mandatory and requires the consent of the minor User’s Parent.</strong>

           The security of Users’ information is important to Us.  We have put in place appropriate security systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure and use of information Users provide to Us.
